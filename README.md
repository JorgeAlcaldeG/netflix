# Netflix style streaming website
This project was developed during my academic studies. It simulates a streaming platform where users can browse and watch films.

## Technology used

 - PHP
 - JavaScript
 - CSS
 - Bootstrap
 - MySql
## Things I would change
At that time I used php for everything, in front and backend, leaving js only to give dynamism to the website.
Now I could use js vanilla/react for the frontend and php only for DB managements like user's login, or resources management.
## What I learnt?
  - Practice in web development.
  - Uploading and file management.
## Features
  - Search by name or / and genre.
  - Sections of the website that can be visited without the need to log in.
  - Watch movies.
  - Login features.
  - Like your favorite movies.
  - Admin features like edit movies or user's management.
  - Top 5 popular films of the web.
## User management
In the website there are 3 types of users:
  - Visitors (users without login)
  - Users (loged users)
  - Admins
And all log users have states:
  - New users (can't login untill admin aproves)
  - Active users (can log in and watch movies)
  - Disabled (can't login)
* All of those satus can be changed with admin privileges.*
